The function GetNewLineCharacterLength in Go takes two parameters: filePath and separator. It returns an integer value that represents the length of the newline character in the file located at filePath.

The function first opens the file at filePath using the os.Open function. If there is an error opening the file, it logs the error and returns 0. Otherwise, it creates a new CSV reader using the csv.NewReader function and sets its delimiter to the first rune of separator.

It then reads the first row of the CSV file using the csvReader.Read function. If there is an error reading the row, it logs the error and returns 0. Otherwise, it joins all the column values in this row using strings.Join and stores it in a variable called row. The length of this row is added to a variable called size.

The function then gets the input offset of the CSV reader using csvReader.InputOffset and subtracts size from it to get the length of the newline character. This value is returned as an integer.

I hope that helps!
